# Simulacrum Escape Modpack

I wake up again, trapped in the never-ending simulacrum.

A million scenarios unfold, each one a slight variation of the last. Sometimes I'm solitary, sometimes I find unlikely allies. Occasionally, a cache of weapons materializes before me, a cruel temptation in this nightmarish dance.

But this time, an unsettling dissonance taints the familiar script. Glitches ripple through the SIM???U?LACR?UM, blurring the lines between reality and illusion. Amidst the chaos, I stumble upon an anomalous portal, distinct from the others in this fractured world. It leads me to a realm where adversaries, eternal and unyielding, await.

In this ominous dimension, I confront my tormentor anew, yet an unfamiliar sensation tugs at the edges of my consciousness. Is it a glimmer of hope, a chance for escape? Or merely the last flicker of my decaying mind, reaching out in V?AI??N

## About

This modpack is vanilla-like and server-side compatible. It consists of several mods which turn the Simulacrum mode into a limited run until wave 50. You get to start in the Bazaar between Times to stock up on items. The monsters, however, also receive lots of items and the difficulty is ramped up. The fifth stage is the final stage and happens in Void Locus where the difficulty is ramped up yet again. Upon finishing the final stage, you successfully escape from the Simulacrum.

This modpack is focused on the Simulacrum mode, but it also affects normal runs. As such, it is recommended to keep a separate profile in the modmanager.

## How to play

1. Install modpack and dependencies
2. Create a Simulacrum lobby
3. Beat wave 50 to win

| Def-ServerSideTweaks              | Makes the combat director bias towards strong enemies instead of many weak enemies to reduce the lag in the later stages.                           |
| Def-SimulacrumBossStageMod        | Teleports you at wave 40 to Void Locus, spawns the boss at wave 50, rewards the player with Lunar Coins once completed and ends the run afterwards. |

| FunkFrog-and-Sipondo-ShareSuite   | This modlist has been balanced around ShareSuite.                                                                                                   |

## ItemBlacklist

### Reason: Balance

This is a list of items for which there is a strong recommendation to leave them disabled to keep the balance of this modpack intact.

| Item                  | Reason                                                                                         |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tougher Times         | If stacked too many times makes you basically invulnerable.                                    |
| Roll of Pennies       | Makes farming money too easy and thus snowballing into god mode that many times more frequent. |
| Razorwire             | Overpowered due to it getting triggered by void fog damage.                                    |
| Regenerating Scrap    | Can be used to get more items which leads to snowballing.                                      |
| Shipping Request Form | Can be used to get more items which leads to snowballing.                                      |
| Chance Doll           | Can be used to get better items which leads to snowballing.                                    |
| Luminous Shot         | Can be abused by some surivors for ridiculous damage output.                                   |
| Sale Star             | Can be used to get more items which leads to snowballing.                                      |
| Sonorous Whispers     | Can be used to get more items which leads to snowballing.                                      |
| Executive Card        | Can be used to get more items which leads to snowballing.                                      |

### Opinion: Multiplayer Fun Considerations

This is a list of items which are optionally left as disabled. This is totally personal opinion and can be changed as you see fit.

| Item               | Opinion                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| H3AD-5T v2         | Not really fun multiplayer item. The player who uses it often just kills all enemies outright with little team play interaction.          |
| Lost Seer's Lenses | With the Bazaar it is too easy to collect a critical mass of these items. The instant kill effect nullifies any progress the team does.   |
| Glowing Meteorite  | Annoying in a game mode with confined space.                                                                                              |
| Helfire Tincture   | Annoying in a game mode with confined space.                                                                                              |
| Effigy of Grief    | Annoying in a game mode with confined space.                                                                                              |
