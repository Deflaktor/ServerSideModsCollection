# SimulacrumNormalStagesFix

This mod fixes some non-Simulacrum stages when they are used in Simulacrum mode. Normally non-Simulacrum stages are not accessable in Simulacrum mode, as such, by its own, this mod does nothing. What this mod does though is the following:

- Removes the void fog entirely in the Bazaar
- Removes the overlapping void fog from the Void Fields stage
- Removes the overlapping void fog from the Void Locus stage
- Fixes the spawn points so that you will actually spawn near the safe ward

This affects only Simulacrum mode. Normal runs are unaffected.

With these fixes applied, this mod can be used in combination with:

- [StageTweaker](https://thunderstore.io/package/pseudopulse/StageTweaker/)
- [StartInBazaar](https://thunderstore.io/package/MagnusMagnuson/StartInBazaar/)
- [SimulacrumBossStageMod](https://thunderstore.io/package/Deflaktor/SimulacrumBossStageMod/)
