# SimulacrumTweaks

A small list of server-side configurable tweaks which only apply to the Simulacrum Mode:

- (ShareSuite only) Forces the loot dropped at the end of each wave to be non-shared.
- A system to prevent greedy players from taking too much of the loot dropped at the end of each wave.
- An option for having a chance for the Artifact of Dissonance to be activated each wave when in the commencement stage to increase enemy variety.
- Slider for the combat director to have a bias towards many, weak enemies or few, strong enemies.
