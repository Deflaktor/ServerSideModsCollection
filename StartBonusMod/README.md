# StartBonusMod

This mod gives every player a configurable set of items and starting cash at the beginning of a run. 
I made it so that I can use [StartInBazaar](https://thunderstore.io/package/MagnusMagnuson/StartInBazaar/) in combination with [BiggerBazaar](https://thunderstore.io/package/MagnusMagnuson/BiggerBazaar/) and/or [BazaarIsMyHome](https://thunderstore.io/package/Lunzir2/BazaarIsMyHome/).
This mod is also compatible with [InLobbyConfig](https://thunderstore.io/package/KingEnderBrine/InLobbyConfig/).
