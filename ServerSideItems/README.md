# ServerSideItems

- NewlyHatchedZoea rework (toggleable)
  - Instead of summoning void creatures, you become Voidtouched. Every 5 (-25% per stack) seconds, fire 3 (+2 per stack) nullifying bombs which immobilize enemies and deal 300% damage. Auto-targets strongest grounded enemy. Corrupts all yellow items.
- ShatterSpleen rework (toggleable)
  - Shatterspleen normally applies dmg based on the combined max health of enemies. This makes it super strong if enemies have health increasing items.
  - This reworks it so that Shatterspleen works on Base Health instead of Combined Health
