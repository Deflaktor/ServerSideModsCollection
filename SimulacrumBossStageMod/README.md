# SimulacrumBossStageMod

This mod makes wave 41-50 happen in Void Locus. It increases the difficulty of these waves and activates Artifact of Honor in the boss waves. After completing wave 50, the player is rewarded with 100 Lunar Coins and the run is ended.

This mod is highly configurable and compatible with [InLobbyConfig](https://thunderstore.io/package/KingEnderBrine/InLobbyConfig/).
Requires [SimulacrumNormalStagesFix](https://thunderstore.io/package/Def/SimulacrumNormalStagesFix/) to work properly.
