# SimulacrumNormalStages

Server-Side compatible - only host needs this mod.

This mod makes Simulacrum play through the normal stages instead of the special Simulacrum stages. Here the detailed changes:

- Uses the normal map pool instead of the simulacrum stages ones (Thanks to [Wolfo](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/)!)
- Optionally places Void Eradictors which erase items from the run (check the config)
- Optionally places Newt Altars to access the Bazaar (check the config)
- Fixes the spawn points so that you will actually spawn near the safe ward
- Removes the void fog entirely in the Bazaar
- Removes the overlapping void fog from the Void Fields stage
- Removes the overlapping void fog from the Void Locus stage
- Removes the exit portal from the Void Fields stage
- Removes the objectives from the Void Fields stage
- Removes the objectives from the Void Locus stage
- Makes the Void Fields stage count as a normal stage in Simulacrum Mode
- Compatibility with InLobbyConfig

This affects only Simulacrum mode. Normal runs are unaffected.

This mod can be used in combination with:

- [StartInBazaar](https://thunderstore.io/package/MagnusMagnuson/StartInBazaar/)
- [SimulacrumBossStageMod](https://thunderstore.io/package/Def/SimulacrumBossStageMod/)
